## Problem <a name="problem"/>
Amazon has been increasing support for accessibility across various accents. However, from our person experience, Amazon’s Alexa appears to sometimes struggle to discerned by Amazon’s Alexa.

## Goal <a name="goal"/>
Our goal is to determine Alexa's ability to recognize different English accents.

## Methodology <a name="method"/>
1. Use AWS Polly to generate speech samples in different accents. 
2. Apply AWS Transcribe convert our speech samples into text.
3. Compare how AWS Transcribe did with genereated speech samples and our own. 

## Tools <a name="tools"/>
1. AWS Transcribe - Converting audio meeting recordings into text (https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/)
2. AWS Polly - Turns text into life like speech (https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)

First, we input text data into the Amazon Polly interface, which will output MP3 files. Then, we will send those MP3 files into a S3 bucket. Using Amazon SageMaker, we will call Amazon Transcribe to transcribe the MP3 files from that bucket. The output of Transcribe is a JSON file, which we will analyze using a Jupyter Notebook. 

 ## Running Our Code <a name="help"/>

### Instructions
### Step 1
First, before we generate our speech samples using AWS Polly. We need to first create a S3 bucket that will store all of our speech samples. To do this, log into your AWS Services account. Search for S3 in the search bar at the top. It should bring you to this page.

We need to then create a bucket where we can store our speech samples. We can do this by selecting the "Create Bucket" button in orange.

We need to create a bucket name. We chose our bucket name to be napoli-bucket and we allowed public access for this bucket. Afterwards, we can select Create Bucket at the bottom of the page. Now, we are ready to generate our speech samples and upload them to the S3 bucket.

### Step 2
Next, we generated our speech samples using AWS Polly. (https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) After logging into your AWS Services account, you should be able to enter text that can be read in different languages and voices. Here we can specify the language for Spanish, English, French, and Hindi.

After inputing the text, we uploaded the text files to the s3 bucket using the graphical user interface (synthesize to S3). After selecting the "Synthesize to S3" Button, a pop up window will be created.

In Step 1, we created a bucket called "napoli-bucket", we can use this bucket name as the name of the bucket here. We can then click "Synthesize" to attach our mp3 file into our S3 bucket!  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48782795/115646766-c7086900-a2f0-11eb-9ac2-e35dc635a464.png)

If we go back to our S3 bucket, we should find the a new mp3 file. Unfortunately, the names of these files are a little arbituary. Therefore, we individually had to rename each one of our files by going into actions and "Rename object". We renamed it into the format of _" language - topic of sentence "_. We repeated these steps for 11 different sentences with Spanish, English, French, and Hindi set as the languages. 

As this process may be a little tedious for everyone. The audio files that we used can be downloaded through our [MP3 files](https://github.com/jongmp/Napoli-Polly/tree/main/MP3%20files) folder on this GitHub Repo. Instructions on uploading our mp3 files are highlighted here.

### Uploading mp3 Files to S3

In our S3 bucket, we should see a orange button called "Upload". We can select "Upload" and it should bring us to a new page that looks like this. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48782795/115648389-56af1700-a2f3-11eb-9d3b-07aea2205ae1.png)

We can then select our [MP3 files](https://github.com/jongmp/Napoli-Polly/tree/main/MP3%20files) to be uploaded with the "Upload Folder" tab. Next, we can just scroll down and select "Upload". 

As shown here, we should now be able to see all of the mp3 files that we have used in your S3 bucket.

### Step 3
Next, through SageMaker we can create an instance. On that instance, we can import the [Data-Transcription](https://github.com/jongmp/Napoli-Polly/blob/main/Data-Transcriptions.ipynb) ipynb file. This file will walk us through the process of utilizing AWS Transcribe to generate texts from these mp3 files that we have created. 
After running this file. We will now have downloaded all of the transcriptions. These should be .json files and they can also be found under our [Transcription](https://github.com/jongmp/Napoli-Polly/tree/main/Transcriptions) folder. 

### Step 4
With these files, we can run our analysis which we performed in [the Analysis Visualization](https://github.com/jongmp/Napoli-Polly/blob/main/Analysis-Visualization.ipynb) file. This file will walk through the methods we utilized to calculate our accuracy and the steps we took to create our visualizations!

### Step 5
That is it! Thank you for following along!
