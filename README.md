## Exploring Alexa's ability to discern accents

## Problem
Accents aren’t always discerned by Amazon’s Alexa, and oftentimes, Alexa executes the wrong commands.

## Goal 
Our goal is to determine Alexa's ability to recognize different English accents.

## Methodology 
1. Use AWS Polly to generate speech samples in different accents. 
2. Record some of our own and friend's accents. 
3. Apply AWS Transcribe convert our speech samples into text.
4. Compare how AWS Transcribe did with genereated speech samples and our own. 

## Tools 
1. AWS Transcribe - Converting audio meeting recordings into text (https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/)

2. AWS Polly - Turns text into life like speech (https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)
